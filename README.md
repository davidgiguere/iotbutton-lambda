# iotbutton-lambda
An AWS Lambda function that sends an email on the click of an IoT button.

I made a few small changes to the standard AWS IoT Lambda function to allow for custom messages for "SINGLE", "DOUBLE" and "LONG" clickTypes. I'm sure other (better) examples may be found and I didn't run across one that easily worked for a novice programmer with the AWS Simple Email Service (SES).
